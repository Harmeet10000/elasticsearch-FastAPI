# Elasticsearch Python Tutorial

Welcome to the Elasticsearch Python Tutorial repository! This resource is designed to help you get better at Elasticsearch using the Python client. Inside, you'll find notebooks, slides, and a YouTube series to guide you through the learning process.

## Repository contents

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with hands-on ElasticSearch examples.
- `slides/`: Presentation slides used in the YouTube series.
- `data/`: Datasets used in the tutorials.

## YouTube series

In this YouTube series, we explain some concepts in details. Each video corresponds to specific notebooks. The notebooks have a prefix in this format `<video_number>_notebook_name`, for example `3_create_index` corresponds to the 3rd video in the series.
